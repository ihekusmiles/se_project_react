## Project description

In this project users are given suggestions on what to wear based on the weather conditions in a given city. This project serves as a transition from a static front-end to a dynamic, API-driven application. In terms of web development, some technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NPM, and modules. This is a priliminary stage and further improvements will come.

**Figma**

In order to make the layout, Figma was used to extract all the necessary design details, eg. font sizes, styles, padding/margin distances etc. The link below:

## Plan on improving project

- I will be adding responsive design in order to show this app correctly on mobile apps or smaller screens.
- Further improvements like liking, and adding card will be added.
- Form validation will also be implemented using Javascript
